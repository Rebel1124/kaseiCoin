# kaseiCoin

## Background

<br>

We will be developing a new monetary system for the first human colony on Mars. Accordingly, it was decided that the new system would use blockchain technology with the new cryptocurrency named KasiCoin.

<br>

## Assignment Screenshots

<br>

## Successful compilation of Smart Contracts

<br>

The screenshots below show the successful compilation of the KaseiCoin, KaseioinCrowdsale and KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer contracts respectively.

## Deployment of the KaseiCoinCrowdsale Contract using Ganache and Metamask

<br>

After linking our ethereum account via metamask to remix, we then deployed the KaseicoinCrowdsaleDeployer Smart Contract.

## KaseiCoinCrowdsale Deployed Contract

<br>

After successfully deploying the contracts, we are able to see the addresses for the kasei_crowdsale and kasei_tokens. We also see the contract that allows us to buy tokens and to see the wei raised.

## Kasei Coin Deployed Contract

<br>

Next we mint the Kasei Coin tokens and after minting we are able to see the balance of coins for an address as well as the totalSupply of Kasei Coins.

## Mint (Buy) Kasei Coin Tokens

<br>

Next, we test our smart contract buy minting (buying) 5 Kasei Coins (1 KSI = 1 ETH) and see the ether as well as gas fees being paid from our metamask account.

<br>

Lastly after minting/buying the 5 Kasei Coins, we then check for the wei raised as well as the total supply of Kasei Coins.
